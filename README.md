<h2>📋 Project Steps Overview</h2>

- Create a Resource Group in Azure  
- Create a Windows Virtual Machine (inside the same Resource Group)  
- Create a Linux Virtual Machine (inside the same Resource Group)   
- Stop & Delete resources to manage costs
<h2>☁️ Step 1: Create a Resource Group in Azure</h2>

- In the **Create Resource Group** form:
  - Ensure the correct **Subscription** is selected.
  - Enter a name for your resource group (e.g., `VM-RG`).
  - Choose a **Region** (recommended: **East US 2** - This region will be selected for ALL Region options coming forward as it will save you from encountaring future headaches).
